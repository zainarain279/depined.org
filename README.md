üñ• Instructions (nodejs required):

1Ô∏è‚É£ To update the module

 npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt

2Ô∏è‚É£ tokens.txt stores tokens, you can get them in 2 ways 

proxy.txt save proxy proxy format: http://user:pass@ip:port

3Ô∏è‚É£ To buff reff, you have 2 options to get code from tokens.txt or from ref_codes.txt file (one ref code per line). Each ref code can only be used 5 times. To activate the ref, you must hang on the node for at least 30 hours. You can find reff code on discord or comment below this post.

Run the buff reff command: node autoRef

Account reff will be in the file accountsReff.txt , token is in the file tokensReff.txt . If you want to hang the account reff node, copy the token from tokensReff.txt to tokens.txt and it will run.

4Ô∏è‚É£ There are 2 ways to run: by gmail (third party login) and by email + password

- C1 : If you have registered through a third party (google,.) and have not changed your password, get the token to run (see step 2 to know how to get the token, the token is permanent so don't worry about it expiring),
üëâ Hang node by token: node main

- C2 : If you register with email + password or log in to a third party and have changed your password: You need to provide account information to the accounts.txt file in email|password format.
üëâ Hang node by command python main.py

===========================
‚ö†Ô∏è Error 400 is incorrect username or password. If you have registered with Google and want to log in with email + password, you must change your password.
